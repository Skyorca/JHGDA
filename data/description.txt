Brazilian air-trac network: Data collected from the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC)1
from January to
December 2016. e network has 131 nodes, 1,038 edges
(diameter is 5). Airport activity is measured by the total
number of landings plus takeos in the corresponding year.

•American air-trac network: Data collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics2
from January to October,
2016. e network has 1,190 nodes, 13,599 edges (diameter
is 8). Airport activity is measured by the total number of
people that passed (arrived plus departed) the airport in
the corresponding period.

European air-trac network: Data collected from the Statistical Oce of the European Union (Eurostat)3
from January
to November 2016. e network has 399 nodes, 5,995 edges
(diameter is 5). Airport activity is measured by the total number of landings plus takeos in the corresponding
period.

For each airport, we assign one of four possible labels corresponding
to their activity. In particular, for each dataset, we use the quartiles
obtained from the empirical activity distribution to split the dataset
in four groups, assigning a dierent label for each group. us, label
1 is given to the 25% less active airports, and so on. Note that all
classes (labels) have the same size (number of airports). Moreover,
classes are related more to the role played by the airport
